Self-worth vs Self doubt
By Grallieson

     A feeling of inadequacy clouds all judgment of self-worth. What else is there to explore when the way things currently are fake, an illusion of one's grandiosity. Self doubt feeds its way into your self-conscious until there is nothing but an emptiness that can never be filled. How are you meant to get out of this rut. Lack of creative or drive to continue. There is nothing that can be done. The paralysis of knowing that the current you is not as good as others or what you make might be derivatives of another's work. Though not as powerful there is nothing more enticing than imagining your world and sharing that vision to those willing to see the work you create. All things have its internal motive for being created. Doing nothing but writing what was already made, repeated, regurgitated slop that was written without plan. Is there a way to silence those fears? Does writing this do anything? Is what you make worth being seen? There is no way of knowing without trying and sharing. When the time comes that copyright does strike, explore the things that are similar. Compare the work and fight back for your own work or accept that the areas that are created are in a way plagiarized and work on diversifying the work. But wait, how do you get past that. It is chance to explore the medium in a new way. Work hard and see your future ventures thrive and live on through the works you create.

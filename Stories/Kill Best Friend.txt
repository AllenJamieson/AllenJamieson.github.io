     I lay on the roof, rifle in hand, preparing to make the shot. My finger sat on the trigger frozen in place. "Take the shot" I heard coming from my side. Looking through the eye piece, I noticed who I was to kill. Holding steady my finger trembled, breath becoming increasing. I pulled my head away.
     "I can't do it, he was my friend" I exclaimed, looking up at my partner.
     "He dies or you both die. You know if he runs free, he will blab about the operation" my partner said.
     With those words I looked back in the peep hole, aimed it at my friend's head. Finger trembling at the trigger. I hear a click sound from behind me which I can only assume to be a gun.
     "Take the shot" he said in a gruff tone.
     I close my eyes and fire to gun. Tears flood my eyes as I attempt to look in the hole to see that he was dead. I put my head in my hands, shocked at what I did.

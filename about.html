        I graduated with a Bacholour of Science in ACS. My interests are creating small programs and writting. The programming languages I tend to lean towatd are Java, SQL, Python, and MASM. I am also trying Defold engine for better portability in game development. My hope is for my content to be enjoyed by many.
